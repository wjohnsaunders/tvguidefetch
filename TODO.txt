This is a list of planned features. If you feel strongly about any feature
please let me know and I will move it up the list.

1) Probably need an option to filter all but the first <display-name> node
   when a channel number <lcn> node is present in the config. MythTV assumes
   the second <display-name> contains the channel number. While this works
   with MythTV it could pose problems for other software.

2) Foxtel default config needs updating. Whenever I put in the effort to
   update it, they go and add new channels. Doing 3 would mean I could
   support and this problem would go away.

3) Make --configure go off to the network to fetch a list of configurations
   to select from. i.e. present the user with a list such as "Foxtel,
   Freeview Sydney, Freeview Melbourne, Freeview NT" which would mean that
   most users would never need to edit the config file, ever. However would
   need to resolve how to host the backend files.
